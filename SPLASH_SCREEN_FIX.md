# Splash Screen Fix Implementation

## What was the problem?
When building the APK, users experienced a white screen flash before the app's custom splash screen appeared. This happened because there was no native splash screen configuration.

## What was fixed?

### 1. Added Native Splash Screen Configuration
- Added `splash` configuration to `app.json` for both global and Android-specific settings
- Set background color to `#000000` (black) to match the app's theme
- Configured splash image to use `cover` resize mode

### 2. Integrated expo-splash-screen
- Installed `expo-splash-screen` package
- Added `expo-splash-screen` plugin to `app.json`
- Updated `SplashScreen.tsx` component to properly handle native splash screen transitions

### 3. Updated SplashScreen Component
- Added `ExpoSplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` to keep native splash visible
- Added proper app readiness state management
- Added `onLayoutRootView` callback to hide native splash at the right time
- Ensured smooth transition between native and custom splash screens

### 4. Enhanced Status Bar
- Set status bar style to `light` with black background for consistency

## How to build APK with the fix

### Method 1: Using EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Method 2: Local Build
```bash
# Prebuild to generate native code
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Build APK using Gradle
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be generated at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Result
- ✅ No more white screen flash
- ✅ Smooth transition from native splash to custom splash
- ✅ Consistent black background throughout the loading process
- ✅ Better user experience during app startup

## Files Modified
1. `app.json` - Added splash screen configuration
2. `components/splash/SplashScreen.tsx` - Integrated expo-splash-screen
3. `app/_layout.tsx` - Updated status bar configuration
4. `eas.json` - Added APK build configuration
5. Added `expo-splash-screen` dependency

The splash screen issue is now completely resolved!
